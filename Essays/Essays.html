                The “myNSFAS” portal is intended to be a critical support system for South African students in need of financial aid, 
                but in practice it falls short of both its ethical and functional responsibilities. Although it appears somewhat usable on a desktop,
                 its mobile performance is poor, with slow loading times, unresponsive buttons, and key features hidden from view. This is especially 
                 troubling given that many students rely on mobile devices to access the service. The design consistently fails to consider the needs
                  of its actual users, assuming instead that everyone has access to high-speed internet, large screens, and digital fluency. This disconnect 
                  is not just a technical oversight but a reflection of a deeper systemic issue. Errors like "session expired" and the inability to track
                   application progress contribute to confusion and anxiety, while contact information is often buried or ineffective. The site creates a sense
                    of distance between the user and the service, treating students as data to be processed rather than individuals in need of support. 
                    These issues are not minor flaws but examples of unethical design choices that reinforce inequality and institutional neglect.
                     A truly ethical and accessible platform would be built on empathy, transparency, and a genuine understanding of the user’s reality. 
                     This is not just a matter of bad design but a failure to care.
