                The “myNSFAS” portal is intended to be a critical support system for South African students in need of financial aid, 
                but in practice it falls short of both its ethical and functional responsibilities. Although it appears somewhat usable on a desktop,
                 its mobile performance is poor, with slow loading times, unresponsive buttons, and key features hidden from view. This is especially 
                 troubling given that many students rely on mobile devices to access the service. The design consistently fails to consider the needs
                  of its actual users, assuming instead that everyone has access to high-speed internet, large screens, and digital fluency. This disconnect 
                  is not just a technical oversight but a reflection of a deeper systemic issue. Errors like "session expired" and the inability to track
                   application progress contribute to confusion and anxiety, while contact information is often buried or ineffective. The site creates a sense
                    of distance between the user and the service, treating students as data to be processed rather than individuals in need of support. 
                    These issues are not minor flaws but examples of unethical design choices that reinforce inequality and institutional neglect.
                     A truly ethical and accessible platform would be built on empathy, transparency, and a genuine understanding of the user’s reality. 
                     This is not just a matter of bad design but a failure to care.<br>

                 This essay investigates how generative AI perpetuates colonial biases by appropriating and erasing Black, Asian,
                  and other non-Western cultures under the guise of creativity and innovation. Drawing on Seyed Mustafa Ali’s concept of decolonial computing,
                   it shows how algorithmic systems reflect and reproduce deep-rooted racial hierarchies, turning rich traditions into flattened, marketable products
                    for Western consumption. From the PS2 filter trend to Ghibli-style prompts, these technologies not only whiten skin tones and detach art from its cultural context,
                     but also undermine the epistemic justice of communities who originally produced these forms. The essay advocates for a decolonial approach, challenging the biases coded into
                      these platforms and exploring ways to reimagine technology to empower, celebrate, and protect culturally specific knowledge and expression.
