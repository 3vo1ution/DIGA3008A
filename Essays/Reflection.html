 <h1> Reflection</h1>

  <div class="h-entry">
<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >Looking back on this project, the implementation process was a huge learning journey for me. My main goal was to translate my UI and UX vision into code while staying true to the ancient Egyptian and Dune inspired theme I had envisioned. I wanted the site to feel like a digital tomb, a space where my work could be archived and explored in a way that was both immersive and functional. Balancing aesthetics with usability was a challenge, especially when ensuring the design adapted seamlessly across different devices. The dark, textured backdrop and hieroglyphic inspired elements had to remain legible and interactive, whether viewed on a desktop or a mobile screen (partially).  </p>
<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >I began by organizing my files to mirror the structure of the site itself. Keeping HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in separate folders helped me maintain clarity as I built out each section. The HTML served as the skeleton, defining the core structure of each page. JavaScript acted like the muscles, handling interactions such as menu toggles and dynamic content, while CSS functioned as the stylistic layer, giving the site its distinctive look and feel. I made sure to use consistent naming conventions and semantic markup wherever possible, though this was tricky at first. Starting later than others meant I had to quickly get up to speed on which tags best represented the content’s role, like using `nav` for navigation bars and `article` for blog posts.  </p>
<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >JavaScript was easily the most difficult part of the process. Figuring out how to manipulate the DOM, handle events, and create responsive interactions took a lot of trial and error, i still sometimes dont get whats going on. At first, I wasn’t sure whether to put all my scripts into one file or break them into modules. I eventually settled on a main JavaScript file and folder with clearly commented sections to keep things manageable. This approach made it easier to debug and reuse functions, like the menu toggle, across multiple pages. Still, there were moments where I felt overwhelmed, especially when trying to implement more complex features without breaking the existing layout.  </p>
<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >One of my biggest struggles was TIME and ensuring the UI remained responsive. I wanted the site to feel cohesive whether viewed on a large monitor or a small phone screen, but achieving this required meticulous adjustments in CSS. Media queries became my best friend, allowing me to tweak layouts, font sizes, and spacing dynamically. I avoided inline styles entirely, relying instead on modular CSS classes that could be reused and updated efficiently. This not only kept the styling consistent but also made the code easier to maintain. For example, the blog cards and navigation bars adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring the user experience stays smooth no matter the device.  </p>
<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >My Javascript also takes so long to load for some reason, my responsiveness was also difficult to properly implement. The PDFViewer API only accepts pdfs that already exist on the web so making my style guide a web document? Or whatever i needed to do was seemingly impossible. I spent so much time trying to get the ux to be consistent with the ui and wasnt able to populate my page as i would have wanted to, but with a good design, adding stuff to the site isnt as difficult as getting the site to work. </p> 
<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >Metadata was another area where I had to pay close attention. I made sure to include descriptive meta tags, like `author` and `description`, to help browsers and search engines understand the content. Alt text for images was also a priority, though I initially overlooked it, and still sometimes made the mistake of forgetting to add it. Realizing this exclusion could alienate users with visual impairments, I went back to add detailed descriptions, reinforcing the importance of accessibility in my design process.  </p>
<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >Reflecting on the project, I see how much I’ve grown in terms of both technical skill and design thinking. The process taught me the value of planning ahead, whether it was structuring files or anticipating how UI elements would behave across devices. While there were frustrating moments, especially with JavaScript, the end result is a site that not only reflects my artistic vision but also functions as a practical, accessible portfolio. Moving forward, I’d love to explore more advanced interactions and refine the performance further, but for now, I’m proud of what I’ve built. It’s a digital tomb that feels alive. </p>
