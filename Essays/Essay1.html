 <h1> Essay 1</h1>

  <div class="h-entry">
<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >The NSFAS website, more specifically the “myNSFAS” portal page of the website is  responsible for facilitating the display of information,
     and hosts applications for aid in the funding of tertiary education, as well as communicating the status of those applications. 
     The “myNSFAS” portal is an essential part of my life and the lives of many South African students pursuing higher education.
      It’s supposed to function as a gateway/facilitator of academic funding and a public service,  playing a high stakes role in the lives of students in need of financial aid. 
      This being considered, accessibility should be a priority given its importance, it should be easy to navigate, clear and transparent in its communication with the user,
       and adaptive across different devices and levels of digital literacy. However, my experience as a consistent user, and that of many others, suggest the complete opposite. 
       Instead the more you use the website the more you realise how much these factors are not considered.</p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >The portal is slow, unresponsive, and poorly optimised for mobile use (specifically in the case of devices with smaller screen sizes),
     despite the fact that many of the students in need of this service rely exclusively on their phones to access it. This disconnect between the website's intended function
      and its actual usability and implementation raises serious concerns not only about its UI/UX design but about the ethics embedded within its interaction design. </p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >Technically, the website provides a seemingly simple user experience. The home page on a desktop (or device with a larger screen) appears functional,
     with a layout that loosely aligns with the NSFAS branding and a seemingly simple structure. This initial impression suggests a coherent and intentional user experience, 
     however that illusion falls apart quickly, especially when accessed via smaller screen sizes. For example, arguably one of the site’s most critical key features, the “Track Application”
      button, is only easily identifiable on larger screen sizes, whereas on smaller screens, it is hidden behind other overlapping tabs/functions and in some cases it is completely
       unidentifiable unless the device is rotated into landscape orientation. This is a striking failure of responsive design, and becomes a clear example of a broader systemic issue,
        that the portal and therefore NSFAS as a whole (due to users only being able to access NSFAS services through this portal), is not designed for the actual users it claims to serve.
         This further justifies the case that "digital inequalities continue to combine with race, class, gender, and other ofﬂine axes of inequality" (Robinson et al., 2015, p 570), 
         further reinforcing that violation of ethical UI/UX design principles are also violations toward the users themselves, reinforcing unjust systems rather than alleviating them. </p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >According to WCAG 2.0 guideline 1.3, “content should be adaptable and maintain its structure across devices” (Caldwell et al., 2008).
     The “myNSFAS” portal and website as a whole violates this principle repeatedly. The site is full of usability flaws including poor use of visual hierarchy, 
     and buttons that lack feedback when clicked etc. These are not just minor inconveniences, they are failures in the UI/UX design that actively limit and obstruct access to
      essential information regarding funding and the status of applications.The site assumes users have stable internet, large screens, and a high degree of digital literacy.
       This very assumption is a stark example of how the website actively alienates the very students who are most vulnerable, reinforcing the structural and systemic inequalities
        that NSFAS is supposed to be there to alleviate, as “groups disadvantaged in their lives ofﬂine may have limited access or use the internet less intensively than their
         more advantaged counterparts" (Robinson et al., 2015, p 570)
The emotional tone of the site can be observed as another one of these issues, although unintentionally created, is one that further perpetuates these inequalities by creating a
 “distance” between the user and the service being provided by the site. Sometimes the portal doesn't even open, with vague error messages such as “session expired”, 
 and crucial information is buried under multiple clicks or only appears after repeated refreshes. Sometimes the portal doesn’t even load at all, 
 freezing with a loading icon that prevents access to its contents. As a public service interface, the site should communicate urgency, care, and transparency, but instead, 
 it often reflects the cold efficiency (or inefficiency rather) of a bureaucratic system more invested in treating students as data subjects rather than in student aid/support. </p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >“Ethical UX design emerges when businesses strike a delicate balance between achieving their objectives and prioritizing user needs”  (S, 2024)
     Yet all these discrepancies highlight a much deeper issue here, one of design justice, one that illustrates how the design of the NSFAS portal is unethical as the user needs are 
     barley a priority. Raising questions as to who is the user imagined by this interface? Clearly not a struggling student using a low-end smartphone with limited data. 
     The portal does not invite engagement, it imposes a process, treated as though it is just means to an end, as though it was something that had to exist rather than a means of bridging
      systemic inequalities. Even the tracking tools on the portal which are arguably another one of the site's key functions, like the progress circles for “Application Details” and
       “Document Submission,” fail to update or reflect any real-time changes. In my three years using the site, these indicators have never displayed anything other than 0%,
        even when I’ve submitted everything required, even right now. This breakdown in feedback mechanisms not only causes confusion but can contribute to anxiety and distrust.
        The lack of knowledge or understanding of such a crucial part of the lives of many students. </p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >Additionally, contact information is neither easily accessible nor reliably functional. At times when support is most needed, like in mine and many other 
    students' cases when the status of a student's application for funding is in limbo, there is no clear path for anybody to speak to in order to find that path for resolution. 
    This lack of human touch in the interaction design reinforces the idea that the user is not a person in need but a “data subject” to be processed rather than cared for. 
    This violates one of the core principles behind ethical UX design, as “Ethical UX design isn’t just about rules and guidelines; it’s about empathy and respect for the people who use 
    our designs” (Mok 2023, p 3). The site, as it stands, does not reflect a value system rooted in empathy, accessibility, or respect for those using the design. It reflects instead the
     dysfunctional and corrupt nature of the government that is issuing this service under the guise of assisting students. </p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > In conclusion, while the NSFAS portal presents itself as a functional bureaucratic tool with the function of assisting students seek financial aid,
     it falls short of its ethical and functional responsibilities as a public digital service. The site’s failures in UI and UX are not merely technical, they are ethical, social,
      and political. They reveal a design that privileges efficiency over empathy, accessibility, and institutional self-preservation (in other words corruption) over the well being 
      of students in need of financial aid. As someone who engages with the site regularly, and as a developing web designer, I see clearly how the design could be improved to better aid
       its supposed target audience. But more than that, I see how the design choices made here reflect broader systemic inequalities and patterns of neglect and exclusion,
        further widening the gap between access to higher education and those in need with intent to seek it, patterns that better UI/UX design has the power, and the responsibility,
         to disrupt.</p>
