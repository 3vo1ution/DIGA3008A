            <p>I Found setting up my GitHub and publishing to Pages as hard to fully grasp and understand as working with GitHub usually is. A website riddled with words and terminologies ive never heard before has always given me a sense of anxiety in how to properly engage with it, ESPECIALLY considering how a simple error could mess EVERYTHING up (speaking from experience). Maybe my past experience has made it more difficult for me in attempting to decipher the riddle that is GitHub, however I do believe that if we had learnt about Githubs role as a software and how to engage with it before having to, it would be easier to approach. However, despite how I feel, I somewhat know how to get around the software. It makes setting up/ hosting a website a little easier than I had thought it would be, especially when its paired with “visual studio code” that literally allows you to push to your repository without having to open github.
           It also makes updating the website a little easier as its a very familiar way of updating software that i had learnt in 2nd year Game Design
           
           For the reading, I chose “The Library of Babel” by Jorge Luis Borges (1941). I find it fascinating how Borges essentially conceptualized the internet long before its arrival, so much so that he was able to theorize problems that currently affect us within the existence of the internet. His depiction of an infinite library filled with every possible combination of letters mirrors the sheer amount of information available online today. The challenges of information overload resonate deeply with my current experience of the internet. With so much access to information and each other, it often feels overwhelming to navigate through just how much is out there. 
           
           Borges discusses the difficulty and pointlessness in searching for meaning in such a chaotic environment, where individuals are bombarded with texts that may be irrelevant or contradictory. This resonates with my own struggles as I am fed countless texts, phots, videos, and social media posts, that often feels so overwhelming that it makes it difficult to willingly engage with the information, almost as though the abundance of information is somewhat uninviting. The library's inhabitants, in their quest for knowledge, remind me of how we seek validation through likes and shares, sometimes losing sight of the genuine pursuit of truth. That in this abundance of knowledge, there is just so much information that we have much access to that we ourselves know less.
           
           Moreover, Borges' explanation that no two books are identical yet many are similar resonates with the repetitive nature of online content, where trends and ideas frequently resurface without any new insights. This  repetitive nature of information can lead to a sense of redundancy, making it challenging to find unique perspectives and information.Borges's work serves as commentary on the complexities of our digital age, where we are consistently overloaded with information, highlighting the paradox of seeking knowledge in an infinite and chaotic landscape, a struggle that continues to shape my experience on the internet today.
           
           My goals for this course are 
           To produce a portfolio that can eloquently display my work to potential employers, institutions, collaborators and also just serve as a place to showcase my work going forward

            <h2>Home page</h2> 
            <img src="Images/HomeWF.jpeg" alt="Home Page Wireframe that illustrates the layout of the homepage, that includes a slider, links to other pages, and a collapsible navbar" width="500px" height="500px">
            My main goal for this site is to showcase myself as an artist, and i want that to direct how users engage with my site. The home page consists of links to all the other pages, followed by a slider that allows users to browse through a selection of my works, with a brief overview of myself as an artist (think elevator pitch). Followed by more links to the rest of the site, the reason theres two sections like this is to emphasise and kinda persuade users into looking through my site, with a navbar with a collapsible menu that serves the same purpose
            
            <h2> Blogs and Essays</h2> 
            <img src="Images/BlogsAndEssaysWF.jpeg" alt="Blog Page Wireframe that illustrates the layout of the blog page, that includes a list of blogs, and a secondary navbar for navigation within the page" width="500px" height="500px">
            My blog and essay sections will have similar layouts as they are both presenting the same type of information using Secondary navbar for navigation within the page That takes users to each subsection of of the page (like each blog etc)
            (brainstorming layout) however i would like for the Design section mto be similar but differ in layout as it is presenting different information
            
            <h2>Portfolio</h2> 
            <img src="Images/PortfolioWF.jpeg" alt="Portfolio Page Wireframe that illustrates the layout of the portfolio page, that includes a list of projects, and a secondary navbar for navigation within the page" width="500px" height="500px">
            I want my portfolio to showcase my best work and if people are keen to see more want them to be linked to a pdf where I that
            serves as an archive of work, including work
            that isn't displayed on the site this is because I don't want the site to be overcrowded with too much information, but i would like for it to have sufficient information to eloquently showcase my talents.
            
            
            Interaction on my website isn’t just about getting from one page to another.It’s about exploring, discovering, and immersing yourself in the experience. Most websites present information in a straightforward, structured way, but I want mine to be something you actively engage with, not just scroll through.
            Here, interaction means users aren’t just viewers but participants, uncovering content through hover effects, smooth transitions, ambient sounds, and shifting glyphs. Every movement feels like revealing a hidden artifact or unlocking an ancient secret, tying directly into the theme of a mysterious, futuristic tomb filled with lost knowledge and treasures.
            In the broader context of the web, interaction shapes how users experience content. Unlike static sites, mine reacts, whether through sound cues, environmental changes, or fluid navigation, making the journey through my work feel seamless and intuitive. It’s not just about usability but about storytelling, guiding users through my artistic and academic work as if they were on an interactive expedition rather than just browsing a portfolio.

     <p>The User Alignment for my website centers on providing an immersive, interactive experience that both showcases my academic and artistic work.
     My design goal is to create a space that feels like an exploration of ancient yet futuristic relics (in the form of my works),
     aligning with the user’s desire for an artistic and academic portfolio that stands out visually and experientially. 

    My goal is designed as an interactive exploration of my work, 
    blending traditional ancient Egyptian styled symbolism with a sci-fi aesthetic (Inspired by futuristic depictions of ancient civilizations,
    such as the technology seen in DUNE).
    The site will feature glowing symbols, stone textures, and a mysterious tomb-like atmosphere filled with hidden treasures.
    ( With the UI/UX design will take inspiration from https://minhpham.design/Links to an external site. ), integrating smooth transitions and hover effects over glyphs/icons. 
    
    With the target audience being users who seek to view my work either for the sake of employment, collaboration or just to view my portfolio.
    I believe users of my website would like an engaging experience that showcases my ability as a designer within  their interaction with my website and through the contents within said website
    
    <h3>Content Mapping:</h3>
    
    My website will serve as a portfolio as well as a place in which various of my academic and creative exploits are stored such as my blogs, essays and design processes.  Showcasing a broad spectrum of artistic and academic works,  i would like content to be categorized according to themes that tie into the overarching concept of a mysterious tomb-like atmosphere, but still categorise the content in a way that is easily accessible and understandable by my user. 
    
    These primary categories will include:
    
    <h4>1.Home/ Landing page</h4>
    
    <h4>2.Blogs</h4>
    
    <h4>3.Design (process)</h4>
    
    <h4>4. Portfolio with sub sections such as </h4>
    
    <h5>Photography</h5>
    <h5>ixed Media (Video, Photography, Digital Illustration)</h5>
    <h5>Web Design</h5>
    <h5>Game Design</h5>
    <h5>Traditional Art and Digital Art</h5>
    <h5>5.My Profile</h5>
    
    
    
    Each section will be marked with thematic visual elements like glowing glyphs or ancient relics, inviting the user to interact and explore in an intuitive, non-traditional way.
    
    <h3>Experience Mapping:</h3>
    
    The experience is focused on organic exploration, where users can uncover content without the limitations of a standard navigation menu. The dynamic layout will shift as users move between sections, creating an engaging journey following my creative journey. Hover effects and subtle animations will guide users' attention to specific pieces, while sound effects, such as ancient whispers or sci-fi chimes, will add to the overall atmosphere, making the exploration feel immersive.
    
    These will include 
    
    Hover-Based Reveals: Glowing symbols or interactive relics will appear on hover, revealing new content or information.
    Smooth Scrolling: The entire site will have smooth transitions to seamlessly navigate from one section to another without too many abrupt shifts, maintaining a sense of flow.
    Environmental Changes: As users explore, subtle shifts in the background (e.g., glowing lights, dust particles) will create the feeling of movement through a created space.
    Interface Mapping:
    
    The UI elements are centered on custom glyphs/icons, resembling hieroglyphics but with a sci-fi twist. These icons will serve as navigational tools, allowing users to access different sections by clicking or hovering over them. They’ll have a glowing or shifting effect to reinforce the mystical, high-tech theme.
    
    Homepage: The homepage will feature a large interactive central glyph or artifact that can be clicked to explore different sections. Visual elements like stone textures and glowing lights will evoke a sense of mystery, drawing users in.
    Navigation: The website's navigation will be integrated into the content, with icons embedded within the thematic layout. These icons will shift or light up when hovered over or clicked.
    Responsive Design: On mobile devices, the layout will adjust to maintain the same immersive feel, using collapsible glyphs or sliding transitions to retain the fluid experience on smaller screens.
     
    
    Even when users discover content through immersive, non-traditional navigation, it’s crucial that each section has a unique URL.
    
     This means designing a URL scheme that reflects the site’s thematic categories 
    
    (e.g.
    
     https://3vo1ution.github.io/DIGA3008A/photography 
    
     https://3vo1ution.github.io/DIGA3008A/mixed-media 
    
    https://3vo1ution.github.io/DIGA3008A/web-design 
    
    so that every section is directly accessible.)
    
    With elements like XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX being used to provide context to search engines and assistive technologies like screen readers.
         This is essential due to th sites  non-linear navigation style where the user experience may not be obvious in the underlying code. Clear semantic tags help both search engines and users understand the content hierarchy and its relationships.
