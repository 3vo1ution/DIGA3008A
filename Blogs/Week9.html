 <h1> Week 9: The right to access </h1>

 <h2><b>Internet Access is a Fundamental Right 
Especially, Amidst a Pandemic</b></h2>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > I think the idea that internet access should be a human right makes a lot of sense,
 especially with how much of our lives now depend on it. Furthermore i think the link between human rights and happiness is justified as one cannot be happy without all their rights.
 The pandemic really exposed how big the digital divide and inequalities are,
 if you don’t have access, you’re basically cut off from education, work, even basic info, a whole portion of the world. </p>

 <p class= “ParagraphContainer” >It’s like you’re locked out of society.
 For me, even when I think about designing my own site, it's based on the idea that anyone who finds it should be able to engage with it easily, but not everyone has the access to even be able to view it. 
 Access is what makes connection possible, and if internet access stays treated like a luxury instead of a right, then a huge part of the population will keep getting left out of not
 just the digital economy but culture, education, and even the chance to express themselves. I feel like moving forward,
 making sure everyone has access to internet is just as important as making sure everyone has food, housing, and education, because of how interconnected the world has become.</p>


 <p class= “ParagraphContainer” > <b>The Need for Global Internet Connectivity</b>
I think the two articles i've chosen go hand in hand,I really connect with the idea that internet access is about more than just being online, t’s about being seen, heard, 
and involved in the online community. Thinking of connection as a need for survival makes sense,
 especially when you realise how much of our lives are now lived online. 
 When I was working on my portfolio site, the whole goal was to represent myself and have people actually find and interact with my work. 
 But if someone doesn’t have access to the internet or doesn’t know how to use it, then they don’t get that chance toe see me. It’s not just a missed opportunity,
  it’s like their voice doesn’t even enter the room.</p>

 <p class= “ParagraphContainer” >What stuck with me is the idea of rural areas having so much to offer, different ideas, stories, products, and the only thing standing in the way is connectivity. That “rural penalty” idea hits hard. It’s wild to think how broadband could completely change someone’s access to education, community, and work, but without it, they’re basically locked out of modern day society.
