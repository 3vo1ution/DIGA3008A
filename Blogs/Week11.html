 <h1> Week 11</h1>

 <div class="h-entry">


<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >“When it comes to our interactions with technology, Africa is often positioned as a beneficiary of technology, not an innovator of it.” (Magenya  2020) </p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > This article allowed a deeper look into the theme of digital inequalities through the lens of how digital inequalities put marginalised groups at risk, 
    specifically in the case of Africa. It serves as a critical reflection on the power dynamics embedded within digital economies and how these shape both access to and participation within
     these economies. 
As an African some quotes stood out to me in how they illustrated the main point of the argument. </p>


<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > The first being “When it comes to our interactions with technology, Africa is often positioned as a beneficiary of technology, not an innovator of it” 
     (Magenya  2020), even though this isn't true, the first time i read it I was able to see how this could be a common misconception.It shows how most of the news and information we get 
     comes from powerful companies that are far removed from our local context. Even though we live on the continent, we don’t always have access to our own stories. That means digital
      artists have an important role in making African voices and perspectives more visible online, especially through independent and creative platforms, as Magenya states
       “A lot of news and information is controlled by media monopolies, that operate in the shadow of Western media houses that most times are better resourced and are able to access
        stories and shape narratives that despite us living on the continent we cannot access.”(Magenya  2020) </p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > The article also illustrates how online content can give visibility to people who are usually ignored. It emphasises how the way we exist within these 
    digital economies can be a tool for resistance and self-expression, making people feel seen and heard when mainstream media doesn’t include them.The internet can be a powerful too
    l for visibility, especially for those who are marginalised such as queer people, people with disabilities, and others whose lives are often ignored in mainstream media.
     Content created by and for these communities becomes a form of resistance, offering alternative ways of being and expressing identity. As artists, we have the opportunity to amplify 
     these voices and ensure they are part of the digital landscape. </p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > However, the same digital spaces that offer connection can also be hostile. Racism, homophobia, and classism still exist online,
     more unapologetically than in person as people hide behind screens, and the people who need support the most often face the greatest barriers. These problems are made worse by
      uneven access to technology. Many are expected to participate in online work, education, or art without having reliable internet or the right devices. This inequality limits who 
      can create, share, and engage.  </p>




<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > All of this shows the importance of making a feminist and inclusive internet, thinking critically about who has power, who is seen,
     and who is left out. As artists, we need to create with awareness, using our platforms to push back against exclusion and make space for others. </p>
