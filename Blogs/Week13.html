 <h1> Week 13</h1>

  <div class="h-entry">
<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > To me an ethical internet is a socialist internet, one of inclusion, care and accessibility to people of all classes, 
    designed around care, consent, and the priority of community rather than profit, extraction and control. An ethical internet would prioritise human dignity,
     with data being gathered with clear and well informed consent, allowing people with fill control of how their data is tracked, used and gathered. Following a decolonial structure, 
     an ethical internet would be designed to acknowledge and embrace diversity in how it provides knowledge and a platform for expression of identity, 
     where all are included, especially historically marginalised groups, without fear of surveillance, harassment or erasure. </p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > Algorithms would be built off decolonial, unbiased datasets that would allow them to be more authentic and accountable,
     shaped by community values and the betterment of the collective rather than commercial, profit based models. This would also mean that accessibility to these platforms
      would be universal and inclusive of even those in the lower classes of society, not just in terms of the platforms themselves, but also linguistically,
       culturally and cognitively inclusive to all levels and ways  of “knowing”, without having an “average user” in mind but rather recognising each user for their uniqueness and 
       individuality. </p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >“When it comes to our interactions with technology, Africa is often positioned as a beneficiary of technology, not an innovator of
     it.” (Magenya  2020)

“At a time when the most vulnerable people are being asked to stay away from others, we are turning to an internet that is bigoted, racist, homophobic and classist for company
 and connections with a wider world.” (Magenya  2020) </p>


<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > Profit and capitalistic concepts would take a backseat or be non existent, employing co operative ownership models and prioritising open source software 
    and the maintenance of said software to ensure that online spaces serve the common good, not corporate monopoLIES (see what I did there). </p>
