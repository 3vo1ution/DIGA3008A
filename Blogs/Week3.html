  <h1>Week 3</h1>

  <p>The User Alignment for my website centers on providing an immersive, interactive experience that both showcases my academic and artistic work.
     My design goal is to create a space that feels like an exploration of ancient yet futuristic relics (in the form of my works),
     aligning with the user’s desire for an artistic and academic portfolio that stands out visually and experientially. 

    My goal is designed as an interactive exploration of my work, 
    blending traditional ancient Egyptian styled symbolism with a sci-fi aesthetic (Inspired by futuristic depictions of ancient civilizations,
    such as the technology seen in DUNE).
    The site will feature glowing symbols, stone textures, and a mysterious tomb-like atmosphere filled with hidden treasures.
    ( With the UI/UX design will take inspiration from <a href="//minhpham.design/ ">Minh Pham</a>Links to an external site. ), 
    integrating smooth transitions and hover effects 
    over glyphs/icons. 
    
    With the target audience being users who seek to view my work either for the sake of employment, collaboration or just to view my portfolio.
    I believe users of my website would like an engaging experience that showcases my ability as a designer within  their interaction with my website and
     through the contents within said website</p>
    
    <h3>Content Mapping:</h3>
    
    <p> My website will serve as a portfolio as well as a place in which various of my academic and creative exploits are stored such as my blogs, essays and design processes.  Showcasing a broad spectrum of artistic and academic works,  i would like content to be categorized according to themes that tie into the overarching concept of a mysterious tomb-like atmosphere, but still categorise the content in a way that is easily accessible and understandable by my user. 
    <br>
    These primary categories will include:  </p>
    
    <h4>1. Home/ Landing page</h4>
    
    <h4>2. Blogs</h4>
    
    <h4>3. Design (process)</h4>
    
    <h4>4. Portfolio with sub sections such as </h4>
    
    <h3>Photography</h3>
    <h3>Mixed Media (Video, Photography, Digital Illustration)</h3>
    <h3>Web Design</h3>
    <h3>Game Design</h3>
    <h3>Traditional Art and Digital Art</h3>
    <h3>5. My Profile</h3>
    
    
    
    <p> Each section will be marked with thematic visual elements like glowing glyphs or ancient relics, inviting the user to interact and explore in an intuitive,
       non-traditional way.  </p>
    
    <h3>Experience Mapping:</h3>
    
    <p>The experience is focused on organic exploration, where users can uncover content without the limitations of a standard navigation menu. The dynamic layout will shift as users move between sections, creating an engaging journey following my creative journey. Hover effects and subtle animations will guide users' attention to specific pieces, while sound effects, such as ancient whispers or sci-fi chimes, will add to the overall atmosphere, making the exploration feel immersive.
    
    These will include 
    
    Hover-Based Reveals: Glowing symbols or interactive relics will appear on hover, revealing new content or information.
    Smooth Scrolling: The entire site will have smooth transitions to seamlessly navigate from one section to another without too many abrupt shifts, maintaining a sense of flow.
    Environmental Changes: As users explore, subtle shifts in the background (e.g., glowing lights, dust particles) will create the feeling of movement through a created space.
    Interface Mapping:
    
    The UI elements are centered on custom glyphs/icons, resembling hieroglyphics but with a sci-fi twist. These icons will serve as navigational tools, allowing users to access different sections by clicking or hovering over them. They’ll have a glowing or shifting effect to reinforce the mystical, high-tech theme.
    
    Homepage: The homepage will feature a large interactive central glyph or artifact that can be clicked to explore different sections. Visual elements like stone textures and glowing lights will evoke a sense of mystery, drawing users in.
    Navigation: The website's navigation will be integrated into the content, with icons embedded within the thematic layout. These icons will shift or light up when hovered over or clicked.
    Responsive Design: On mobile devices, the layout will adjust to maintain the same immersive feel, using collapsible glyphs or sliding transitions to retain the fluid experience on smaller screens.
     
    
    Even when users discover content through immersive, non-traditional navigation, it’s crucial that each section has a unique URL.
    
     This means designing a URL scheme that reflects the site’s thematic categories 
    
    (e.g.
    
     https://3vo1ution.github.io/DIGA3008A/photography 
    
     https://3vo1ution.github.io/DIGA3008A/mixed-media 
    
    https://3vo1ution.github.io/DIGA3008A/web-design 
    
    so that every section is directly accessible.)
    
    With elements like XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX being used to provide context to search engines and assistive technologies like screen readers.
         This is essential due to th sites  non-linear navigation style where the user experience may not be obvious in the underlying code. Clear semantic tags help both search engines and users understand the content hierarchy and its relationships.
        </p>
