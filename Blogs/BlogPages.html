            as Id imagine building the pyramids of giza would be. I had started this process 3 weeks behind after fighting a battle (my registration) that felt like it
            had spanned an entire year. Having to catch up on the setting up while finding out wtf is an HTML AND beginning to find a concept that I felt would best
            represent my work and myself was no easy task, but I imagine Pharaohs didnt have a lot of those either so why should I.<br>

            <li><a class="u-url h-entry BlogPost" href="Week2.html"><h3 class="BlogHeading">World Domination plan</h3><br>Sourcing resources (reference material)
                 for the construction of my tomb felt like assembling an ancient powerful sacred scroll from fragments scattered across digital empires. 
                 Each source of reference/ link I collected became shimmering examples of how the modern web could tell my story and show my rule.
                  Like choosing the right stone for a pyramid chamber, each site brought forward a different lesson: fluid motion, elegance in layout, 
                  or immersive storytelling. Designing the homepage became like designing the ritual ground, a space not just to greet, but to enchant, 
                  with sliders as shifting hieroglyphics and collapsible menus as secret doors.
                   As I  considered the types of the interaction I wanted to facilitate  like hover effects, ambient whispers,
                    stylised transitions I realised I didn't want this website to be just browsing through my work, but more a journey through a digital necropolis, 
                    where each click uncovers something sacred. <br>

            <li><a class="u-url p-name" href="Week3.html"><h3 class="BlogHeading">Building a Digital Tomb Through User Alignment and Structure</h3><br> Mapping
                 out my User alignment and site structure felt like sketching blueprints on papyrus in a dimly lit chamber,
                  with the action being both part ritual and part revelation. Although somewhat difficult due to my inability to focus on one idea at a time.<br> 
                  From the beginning, all I knew the site had to be more than a portfolio, it had to be an excavation of my identity as an artist and thinker. The goal wasn't simply to present content, it was to immerse the user in a digitally-forged tomb where each interaction unearthed relics of academic and creative labour. I wanted the homepage to act as the grand entrance, the Blogs and Design sections as script-covered walls narrating process and philosophy, and the Portfolio as a curated treasure vault, each subcategory a sarcophagus of specific media. But unlike a linear/ traditional webpage, this space encourages wandering. 
                Experience mapping became a matter of storytelling: how does someone feel their way through my work?
                 Not with dropdowns and sidebars, but with shifting shadows, glowing artifacts, and seamless motion.
                  It’s an interaction model that prioritizes sensation over instruction. And yet, for all its mystery, clarity remains essential. 
                  Each hidden path must still have coordinates. 
                  That’s where semantic HTML and clean URL structures come in serving not just the logic of search engines and screen readers, 
                  but ensuring that even the most abstract layout still contains legible code beneath. Building this isn’t just about aesthetics, 
                  it’s about creating an accessible, immersive archive, a digital tomb where art, writing, and design are unearthed through ritual, not routine.<br>

                <li> <a class="u-url p-name" href="Week4.html"><h3 class="BlogHeading">Making The tomb In My Image (Think:Sphinx) </h3><br> Week 4
                     felt like I was finally brushing dust off the tomb walls and uncovering what this thing was <b>really</b> going to be.
                    I’d been sitting with a million ideas, some golden, some half-sketched in the dirt, and this was the week they started forming into something more 
                    than just vibes and ideas. The concept had always been there in fragments, some mix between ancient Egypt and deep space, hieroglyphics and hard light,DUNE,
                    relics and responsive design. But here’s where I started laying out what that meant in terms of actual interaction, structure and most impost importantly 
                    an ACTUAL site.
                    The most important thing for me was for the portfolio itself to be a representation of my thinking and capability. Every hover, every scroll 
                    needs to feel like you've just found something you can't find anywhere else. Inspired by the clean UI/UX sorcery of Minh Pham’s and…DUNE,
                     I knew I didn’t want flat menus and boring grids. Instead, I wanted glowing glyphs, floating dust, and stone textures that made you feel
                      like you’d stumbled into some long-lost archive that also happened to be my creative expression.
                    I mainly excited to create a thought out spectrum of my work, categorised like relics in a chamber, 
                    not folders in a filing cabinet. The layout had to be fluid, interconnected, and responsive, but also feel like walking deeper into some digital tomb. 
                    Animations would guide users like torches on the wall, sound effects like whispers confirming they were in the right place.
                    Even the about/contact section had to be part of the story. Think: a high-tech sarcophagus with glowing buttons that ripple when touched.
                     This wasn’t just design for design’s sake, it was about building a space that reflects how I think and make. 
                     A portfolio, yes. But also a digital excavation site where you don’t just see my work, you feel it take place.

                    a single reason that week 1 had any difficulty, would be cause of NSFAS. And so I would like to inscribe the walls of my tomb with my anger at in incoherent system,
                    while also showing off a system of my own that I think is better, but then again, most things are.

                        To be disconnected is to vanish, No signal, No access, No voice. The pandemic revealed the truth, that without internet, people were cut off from education, 
                        from work, from the world. When I design, I think about accessibility, who is able to engage with my work and who gets left out. 
                        Creating a space that anyone can enter, but what if they never even see the door Connection is not a luxury, It is the ground beneath our digital lives. 
                        It is how we speak,  How we create,  How we are seen. 
                        To connect is to belong and no one should be left in the dark

                In the scrolls of the modern world Kasapis writes of a right not etched in stone but in signal and screen. He speaks of happiness not as a fleeting breeze but as a birthright bound to food health knowledge and now to the flow of the internet. The virus came like a desert wind revealing the cracks in the temples of progress. As the wealthy built digital pyramids the many were left outside the gates without data without voice. Kasapis does not merely mourn the imbalance he questions the architects. Who draws the borders of the digital kingdom Who commands its gates. If the net is the new Nile then let all drink. A just realm cannot rise when only the few are seen by the eye of the web.

                <li> <a class="u-url p-name" href="Week11.html"><h3 class="BlogHeading">Digital Inequality</h3><br>
                   
Africa is often seen only as a user of technology rather than a creator. This article explores how digital inequalities put marginalized groups at risk, especially in Africa. Media controlled from outside the continent often hides local stories. Digital artists play a vital role in making African voices visible online. The internet offers a space for those ignored by mainstream media to express themselves and resist exclusion. However, online spaces can also be hostile with racism and other barriers made worse by unequal access to technology. This highlights the need for a feminist and inclusive internet where power and visibility are shared. Artists have the responsibility to create with awareness and open space for all voices.

              <li> <a class="u-url p-name" href="Week12.html"><h3 class="BlogHeading">Crafting Inclusive Digital Journeys</h3><br>
                   
While rushing to finish my portfolio, I overlooked adding alt text to images, which seemed minor but revealed a serious issue: excluding users who cannot see well. This exclusion is a form of ableism and reinforces societal marginalization. As an African web developer, I must build with empathy and accountability, understanding who I include and who I shut out. Accessibility goes beyond alt text to responsive design and user-centered thinking. The NSFAS website’s failure to adapt to small screens creates real barriers and digital alienation, showing that ignoring user needs perpetuates exclusion. As I add JavaScript to my site, I aim to create an experience that feels tactile and immersive, like exploring an ancient tomb with responsive glyphs and dynamic galleries. These interactions guide curiosity and reflection rather than just displaying content, shaping a digital space that invites exploration and connection instead of exclusion.

             <li> <a class="u-url p-name" href="Week13.html"><h3 class="BlogHeading">Envisioning an Ethical Internet</h3><br>
                   
An ethical internet values inclusion, care, and accessibility for all, prioritizing community over profit. It ensures data is collected with consent and respects diverse identities, protecting marginalized groups. Algorithms would be unbiased and community-driven, while access is universal and culturally inclusive. Africa should be recognized as an innovator, not just a beneficiary. Profit motives would give way to cooperative ownership and open-source models serving the common good.
