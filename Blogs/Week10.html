 <h1> Week 10</h1>

 <p class= “ParagraphContainer” > In the first paragraph, Kasapis begins the article by defining human rights by linking them to happiness , 
    emphasising how happiness itself is a human right, not a condition or state to be pursued(Kasapis, 2020). Using Salvador Allende’s claim that happiness is impeded by lack of food,
     education, healthcare, and fair work, to affirm this claim. Kasapis uses this opening argument to not only define what a human right is to affirm how internet access is one of them,
      but also to help the reader understand the importance of what exactly a human right is. These points are all the more important to consider in the new “digital age”
       ushered in by the pandemic, highlighting that in a time where a huge percentage of the world's population and information is accessible primarily within the digital space,
        it is important to ensure everyone has access to that space </p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > He follows up on this point by highlighting the inequalities that the general lack of this access to digital spaces produces, 
    viewing the coronavirus pandemic as a catalyst in highlighting these inequalities he refers to as “digital inequalities” (Kasapis, 2020) , 
    a moment that exposes the structural inequalities of the digital era. Here, Kasapis identifies the virus not only as a biological threat but as a mirror to the failures 
    of capitalist society.The suspension of physical interaction forced society into a digital economy that not everyone has access to. Kasapis doesn’t just say that this is unfair, 
    he shows how digital access has become a gatekeeper to even the opportunity of participating within the digital economy. It's not just about logging on, it’s about who gets to 
    live fully and who gets left out.</p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >Kasapis does this by comparing billionaires like Jeff Bezos expanding their empires through the digital economy while half the world can’t even get online.
      Asserting that its not just about inequality anymore but more about how digital systems are now the main systems, and being excluded from them is a new kind of systemic barrier.
       What Kasapis is showing isn’t some futuristic dystopia, it’s a dystopia that is already happening. </p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > He ends the article by asking the real questions brought about by his findings. 
    Should access to the internet be guaranteed for everyone? And if so, who decides how the internet works and who it serves? Kasapis makes it clear that if we’re going to talk about rights,
     we have to talk about power, and in doing so we need to define who has it, who doesn’t, and who gets to shape the rules. In the end,
      his call is simple, a digital society can’t be fair if only a few people get to participate. Like in any society, everyone should have a voice, 
      and the internet should be no different. </p>
