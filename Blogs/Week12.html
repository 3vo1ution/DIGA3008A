 <h1> Week 12</h1>

  <div class="h-entry">
 <p class= “ParagraphContainer” > While putting together the portfolio section of my site, I was racing against the clock to meet the submission deadline.
     In the rush, I forgot to add alt text to any of the images on the page. At the time, it seemed like a small oversight because it didn’t directly impact my ability to navigate the site.
      But that assumption reveals a serious blind spot and a grander issue within creating digital environments. By failing to consider those who don’t share my ability to see,
       I excluded a whole group of users from the experience. That exclusion, even if unintentional, is still a form of ableism and the alienation of groups already marginalised within 
       society. And when designing digital spaces as a developing African web developer, where issues of access and inclusion are already pressing, that’s not something I can afford to
        ignore. I cannot perpetuate the very patterns and systems that exclude me due to me being in a different social standing.
 My work needs to be grounded in empathy and accountability. I need to see beyond my own perspective and pay more mind to who I am building this to show, and who might I be shutting out? </p>


<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > Accessibility isn’t only about alt text. It’s about responsive design, and user-centered thinking. 
    A major frustration I’ve had with the NSFAS website, which I wrote about in my essay, is how it fails to adapt to smaller screens, which a large contingency of the general 
    South African populace is likely to use. That failure distances me as a user from information I urgently need. Feeling digitally alienated from a system meant to support me made 
    something clear, the exclusion wasn’t abstract. By not considering the user, I am perpetuating these exclusive, unethical practices, even if my actions are born from ignorance and not 
    malice. It reminded me that coding without care reinforces the same systems of exclusion I’m trying to resist. So my development process must remain attentive to how structure, language,
     and interaction either invite people in or push them out. </p>


<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > As I started incorporating more JavaScript into my site, I wanted it to reflect more than functionality, it needed to serve the feeling of the space. 
    My goal is to build an experience that’s tactile, like walking through an ACTUAL tomb where light shifts and glyphs respond to your presence.
     I’m currently working on dynamic galleries and carousels that allow viewers to move through images, videos, and animations without leaving the page, 
     showcasing the main things I would like to be displayed to the user, regardless of if they click on my portfolio page or not. 
     I am also working on heading animations/effects that feel more like an ancient mechanism unlocking rather than just text appearing. </p>


<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > But beyond flair, JavaScript is helping me shape interaction in a way that aligns with how I want users to navigate my site. 
    I want the website to feel less like a menu and more like a showcase of my thought process and imagination. To do this, I’m exploring scripts that reveal content as the user scrolls 
    or moves their mouse, symbol interactions that respond with subtle light, and even small guided animations within the heiroglyphics within my site’s background, that create a sense of 
    journey and exploration,  rather than static browsing.  Making hieroglyphics clickable, with each clickable one erevealing a hidden piece of the archive,
     like a glyph puzzle that unlocks memories or artefacts would deeply enhance and add to my intended user experience. </p>


<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > These enhancements are not about spectacle. They’re about guiding the viewer down a path of curiosity and reflection,
     mirroring my own process as an artist and web developer. </p>
