        <h2>Home page</h2> 
        <img src="Images/HomeWF.jpeg" alt="Home Page Wireframe that illustrates the layout of the homepage, that includes a slider, links to other pages, and a collapsible navbar" width="500px" height="500px">
        My main goal for this site is to showcase myself as an artist, and i want that to direct how users engage with my site. The home page consists of links to all the other pages, followed by a slider that allows users to browse through a selection of my works, with a brief overview of myself as an artist (think elevator pitch). Followed by more links to the rest of the site, the reason theres two sections like this is to emphasise and kinda persuade users into looking through my site, with a navbar with a collapsible menu that serves the same purpose
        
        <h2> Blogs and Essays</h2> 
        <img src="Images/BlogsAndEssaysWF.jpeg" alt="Blog Page Wireframe that illustrates the layout of the blog page, that includes a list of blogs, and a secondary navbar for navigation within the page" width="500px" height="500px">
        My blog and essay sections will have similar layouts as they are both presenting the same type of information using Secondary navbar for navigation within the page That takes users to each subsection of of the page (like each blog etc)
        (brainstorming layout) however i would like for the Design section mto be similar but differ in layout as it is presenting different information
        
        <h2>Portfolio</h2> 
        <img src="Images/PortfolioWF.jpeg" alt="Portfolio Page Wireframe that illustrates the layout of the portfolio page, that includes a list of projects, and a secondary navbar for navigation within the page" width="500px" height="500px">
        I want my portfolio to showcase my best work and if people are keen to see more want them to be linked to a pdf where I that
        serves as an archive of work, including work
        that isn't displayed on the site this is because I don't want the site to be overcrowded with too much information, but i would like for it to have sufficient information to eloquently showcase my talents.
        
        
        Interaction on my website isn’t just about getting from one page to another.It’s about exploring, discovering, and immersing yourself in the experience. Most websites present information in a straightforward, structured way, but I want mine to be something you actively engage with, not just scroll through.
        Here, interaction means users aren’t just viewers but participants, uncovering content through hover effects, smooth transitions, ambient sounds, and shifting glyphs. Every movement feels like revealing a hidden artifact or unlocking an ancient secret, tying directly into the theme of a mysterious, futuristic tomb filled with lost knowledge and treasures.
        In the broader context of the web, interaction shapes how users experience content. Unlike static sites, mine reacts, whether through sound cues, environmental changes, or fluid navigation, making the journey through my work feel seamless and intuitive. It’s not just about usability but about storytelling, guiding users through my artistic and academic work as if they were on an interactive expedition rather than just browsing a portfolio.
