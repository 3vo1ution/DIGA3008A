 <h1> Week 1</h1>

  <div class="h-entry">
<p class= “ParagraphContainer” > I Found setting up my GitHub and publishing to Pages as hard to fully grasp and understand as working with GitHub usually is. A website riddled with words and terminologies ive never heard before has always given me a sense of anxiety in how to properly engage with it, ESPECIALLY considering how a simple error could mess EVERYTHING up (speaking from experience). Maybe my past experience has made it more difficult for me in attempting to decipher the riddle that is GitHub, however I do believe that if we had learnt about Githubs role as a software and how to engage with it before having to, it would be easier to approach. However, despite how I feel, I somewhat know how to get around the software. It makes setting up/ hosting a website a little easier than I had thought it would be, especially when its paired with “visual studio code” that literally allows you to push to your repository without having to open github.
It also makes updating the website a little easier as its a very familiar way of updating software that i had learnt in 2nd year Game Design</p>

<p class= “ParagraphContainer” >For the reading, I chose “The Library of Babel” by Jorge Luis Borges (1941). I find it fascinating how Borges essentially conceptualized the internet long before its arrival, so much so that he was able to theorize problems that currently affect us within the existence of the internet. His depiction of an infinite library filled with every possible combination of letters mirrors the sheer amount of information available online today. The challenges of information overload resonate deeply with my current experience of the internet. With so much access to information and each other, it often feels overwhelming to navigate through just how much is out there. 

Borges discusses the difficulty and pointlessness in searching for meaning in such a chaotic environment, where individuals are bombarded with texts that may be irrelevant or contradictory. This resonates with my own struggles as I am fed countless texts, phots, videos, and social media posts, that often feels so overwhelming that it makes it difficult to willingly engage with the information, almost as though the abundance of information is somewhat uninviting. The library's inhabitants, in their quest for knowledge, remind me of how we seek validation through likes and shares, sometimes losing sight of the genuine pursuit of truth. That in this abundance of knowledge, there is just so much information that we have much access to that we ourselves know less.

Moreover, Borges' explanation that no two books are identical yet many are similar resonates with the repetitive nature of online content, where trends and ideas frequently resurface without any new insights. This  repetitive nature of information can lead to a sense of redundancy, making it challenging to find unique perspectives and information.Borges's work serves as commentary on the complexities of our digital age, where we are consistently overloaded with information, highlighting the paradox of seeking knowledge in an infinite and chaotic landscape, a struggle that continues to shape my experience on the internet today.

My goals for this course are 
To produce a portfolio that can eloquently display my work to potential employers, institutions, collaborators and also just serve as a place to showcase my work going forward
Id also like to increase my Repertoire and proficiency in the programming languages i know and in those i will learn in this course to make me more versatile in the digital landscape 
Id like to gain web development as a skill that i can continue to apply throughout my life as a digital artist and to engage with the web with a deeper understanding0 of the processes that allow me to engage with it
