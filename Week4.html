    <p><h2>Concept & Theme</h2>
    This portfolio website is designed as an interactive exploration of my work, blending traditional Egyptian motifs with a sci-fi aesthetic. Inspired by futuristic depictions of ancient civilizations, such as the technology seen in <em>DUNE</em>, the site will feature glowing symbols, stone textures, and a mysterious tomb-like atmosphere filled with hidden treasures. The UI/UX design will take inspiration from <a href="https://minhpham.design/" target="_blank">this site</a>, integrating smooth transitions, hover effects, and an immersive storytelling approach.

    <h2>Purpose & Content</h2>
    The website serves as both an academic project and a personal portfolio, showcasing a diverse range of artistic works, including:
    <ul>
        <li>Photography</li>
        <li>Mixed Media (Video, Photography, Digital Illustration)</li>
        <li>Web Design</li>
        <li>Game Design</li>
        <li>Traditional Art</li>
        <li>Digital Art</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Design & Aesthetic Elements</h2>
    
    <h3>Color Scheme</h3>
    Dark, atmospheric tones with gold and stone textures, evoking the ambiance of an ancient yet advanced civilization.

    <h3>Typography & Symbols</h3>
    Custom glyphs/icons resembling hieroglyphics will be used for navigation and interaction, maintaining a futuristic yet historical feel.

    <h3>Animations</h3>
    The site will feature shifting glyphs, glowing artifacts, and floating dust particles to enhance the mystical atmosphere.

    <h3>Sound Design</h3>
    Ambient sound effects, including ancient whispers and sci-fi chimes, will create an immersive experience.

    <h3>Sound Toggle</h3>
    Users will have the option to enable/disable sound effects.

    <h2>Navigation & Interactivity</h2>
    
    <h3>Fluid, Interconnected Layout</h3>
    Instead of a traditional menu, the site will use a dynamic exploration-based navigation system where sections transition seamlessly while maintaining distinct categories.

    <h3>Thematic Hubs</h3>
    Different types of work will be subtly categorized using thematic visual elements (e.g., relics, glowing glyphs, or interactive pathways).

    <h3>Interactive Animations</h3>
    Hover-based reveals, smooth scroll effects, and ambient environmental changes will encourage users to explore naturally without disrupting access to content.

    <h3>Contact/About Section</h3>
    A sleek, futuristic interface embedded within the tombâ€™s design will provide access to social media and email, featuring interactive animations such as symbols lighting up, holographic effects, and ripple effects upon interaction.

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    This project will combine artistic presentation with interactive web technologies, resulting in a visually and experientially unique portfolio. The goal is to craft an immersive space where users can explore my work organically, experiencing it as if uncovering artifacts of a lost yet advanced civilization. </p>
