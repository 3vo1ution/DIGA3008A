<h1>Wireframes</h1>
<h4>Initial Planning</h4>
<img src="../Images/PlanningWireframes.jpeg" alt=" A collection of wireframes that illustrate the layout of the homepage, blog page, and portfolio page, showcasing the placement of elements and content" width="500px" height="500px">
<p>The wireframes above illustrate the layout of the homepage, blog page, and portfolio page, showcasing the placement of elements and content. The homepage features a slider with a brief overview of my work,
    followed by links to other pages. The blog page lists entries with a secondary navbar for navigation, while the portfolio page displays projects with a secondary navbar for navigation. 
    These wireframes serve as a blueprint for the site’s structure and content placement, ensuring a cohesive and engaging user experience. </p>

<img src="../Images/InitialPlanningWF.jpeg" alt="A wireframe that illustrates the first layout of the home page, showcasing the placement of elements and content" width="500px" height="500px">

    <h4>Home page</h4> 
    <img src="../Images/HomeWF.jpeg" alt="Home Page Wireframe that illustrates the layout of the homepage, that includes a slider, links to other pages, and a collapsible navbar" width="500px" height="500px">
    <p> My main goal for this site is to showcase myself as an artist, and i want that to direct how users engage with my site. The home page consists of links to all the other pages, 
        followed by a slider that allows users to browse through a selection of my works, with a brief overview of myself as an artist (think elevator pitch). 
        Followed by more links to the rest of the site, the reason theres two sections like this is to emphasise and kinda persuade users into looking through my site, 
        with a navbar with a collapsible menu that serves the same purpose </p>
    
    <h4> Blogs and Essays</h4> 
    <img src="../Images/BlogsAndEssaysWF.jpeg" alt="Blog Page Wireframe that illustrates the layout of the blog page, that includes a list of blogs, and a secondary navbar for navigation within the page" width="500px" height="500px">
    <p>My blog and essay sections will have similar layouts as they are both presenting the same type of information using Secondary navbar for navigation within the page That takes users to each 
    subsection of of the page (like each blog etc)
    (brainstorming layout) however i would like for the Design section mto be similar but differ in layout as it is presenting different information</p>
    
    <h4>Portfolio</h4> 
    <img src="../Images/PortfolioWF.jpeg" alt="Portfolio Page Wireframe that illustrates the layout of the portfolio page, that includes a list of projects, and a secondary navbar for navigation within the page" width="500px" height="500px">
     <p>I want my portfolio to showcase my best work and if people are keen to see more want them to be linked to a pdf where I that
    serves as an archive of work, including work
    that isn't displayed on the site this is because I don't want the site to be overcrowded with too much information, but i would like for it to have sufficient information to eloquently showcase my talents. </p>

    <h4>Semi-Final Draft Wireframes</h4>
    <img src="../Images/AllWireframesV2.jpeg" alt=" Wireframes that illustrate the final layout of all the pages with colour, showcasing the placement of elements and content" >
    <p>The Semi final wireframe above illustrates the final layout of the webpages in colour. I had chosen Blue before because it is my favourite colour however it didnt oair too well with the other
        colours I intended to use. So in this iteration, and ones to come, of the website I opted to using Black for starker contrasts and a more  cohesive and consistent look
