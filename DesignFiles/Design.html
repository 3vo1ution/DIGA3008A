       <h3> My Goal</h3>
<p>My Primary goal for my Website is to Showcase my <b>Work</b> and design processes (specifically in the case of the website, however it does give further insight into my creative process at large). My aim is for this site to be a place to display my academic, creative, and design work in a visually engaging and cohesive manner that aligns with me as an artist and how I'd like my work to be portrayed in a digital space . <br>
By merging ancient Egyptian motifs with a futuristic sci-fi aesthetic,  my goal is to showcase myself as a unique designer whose work stands apart from conventional portfolios in an Indigenous African aesthetic,
that mirrors myself as an African Artist. <br> 
I want to encourage users to discover my content naturally in an organic and cohesive manner that makes navigating through my site as intuitive as possible, to encourage users to stay on my site and continue to browse through, conveying a sense of exploration through my work. <br>
I want users to feel as though they are exploring an ancient tomb/pyramid filled with mystique and wonder. Whether the user is looking to employ, collaborate, or simply explore my portfolio, the goal for the site is that it enables them to interact meaningfully with my work and easily get in touch.

<h3>Design Inspiration (Reference Material)</h3>

 <p><a class="RefLinks" href="https://www.gucci.com/za/en_gb/">Gucci(UI/UX and layout) inspo</a>  - The Gucci Website for me is quite admirable for its UI/UX design. It has transitional effects such as the Gucci Logo shrinking into the navbar as you scroll down the homepage, coupled with a clean layout and presentation of data, using hover effects and straying from an information overload. These elements provide an organed yet polished experience that i wish to achieve with my site. <br>

 <a class="RefLinks" href="https://www.hermes.com/us/en/">Hermes(further UI/UX and layout) inspo</a> - The Hemes Website is quite similar to the gucci one, however it features less stylistic elements. However the few they do employ are polished to achieve a sense of luxury and quality as you browse through the site, using some elements present on the gucci site in a more polished manner, or rather, in a manner that would better work with my site. <br>
 <a class="RefLinks" href="https://joshua-jandrell.github.io/JJ_Website/index.html#home">Joshua’s Portfolio (Navigation, UI, UX, Home)</a> - Out of all past student work this one stood out to me the most. Im inspired by how the Homepage (and some of the others) “evovles” as you scroll through with transitional effects and UI elements that make navigating through Joshuas portfolio feel intuitive, engaging and organic. Which is essentially how id like browsing through my website to feel <br>
 <a class="RefLinks" href="https://loonars.com/project/venus/"> Venus project </a>(aesthetic and design elements) <br>
 <a class="RefLinks" href="https://www.theshipwrecksurvey.com/"> The Shipwreck </a>(aesthetic and layout) <br>
 <a class="RefLinks" href="https://minhpham.design/">Minh Pham</a> (aesthetic, UX and layout) <br>
 <a class="RefLinks" href="https://www.pistola.in/">Pistola</a> (aesthetic) <br>
 <a class="RefLinks" href="https://200.allens.com.au/"> 200 Allens</a>(Similar to how i want the experience of my site to be)
 <p>The thematic nature of the above listed websites and how the overall webdesign and elements are shaped around an experience the web designers want to covey, 
  using unique animations, UI elements such as a custom cursor, and just how the information is presented has given me a lot of inspiration in how id like to style my website around the
   intended experience id like for the user to experience in exploring my work and myself as an artist.</p>
