                                  Ridiculed and cursed for embracing the
                                  wings given to you by the very world that

                                   by the society that pretends to love you
                               The sky waits for you
Young black boy, fighting for love from the
very doves that cause you harm in your
conquest for peace and harmony
Fighting and fighting for a goal that seems
achievable yet unobtainable
Fighting on a land drenched in the blood of
your brothers and sisters, mothers and
[athers
Aland taken from you from the world that
you care for so deeply
One which had mothered your people, now
stripped of what made it sacred, stripped of
what made it a home, your home
The mountains weep for you
Young black girl, seen as a pebble in a
world of Jewels
Only valued by your shape or shade
Broken down and disgraced by the world
which birthed you
Stripped of what makes you pure, by the
crows, jewels and doves to whom you show
compassion
The seas roar </p>

The love of a mother is rivaled by no other:
From the tender acts of care,
to the happiness we share.
How can this not be compared
to the love of God?

When the presence of a woman
radiates the benevolence
He proceeds to show us,
time and time again.

Bringing new life to experience
His wonderful creation,
while being masterpieces
of this creation themselves.

How could one not see
a reflection of His kindness
through the existence of a woman?

When women create, love, teach,
raise, care, nurture, protect, and give
just as God does.

When they themselves are indications
of the time, precision, thought, and care
the Lord put into this work of art
we were gifted and lucky enough
to call home.

A home that cannot exist without a woman.
For everything God has gifted usâ€”
the love, care, and happiness,
to Mother Nature herself
remains a gift that truly shows
God's love for us.

There is a reason the best parts of our planet
are seen in Mother Nature:
Because the nature of God
is that of a mother.

Because a woman is God's image.

                    <p class="CardExcerpt"> In this bucket containing the crabs
that are its people,
the idea of freedom seems desirable
yet unachievable.

They see a fraction of the sky above,
taunting them with its vastness,
yet they are never able to make it out.

Gnawing at each other while they all
fight for a taste of the heavens,
unable to see the goal they all have in common.

The ocean waits for them, while they
continue to squabble, unable to see
that only together are they able
to achieve this goal.

For the bucket is too high for one to climb,
yet as a unit it is but a small feat.

In giving up themselves, they could easily
achieve the unachievable and kiss the heavens,
and get a taste of that freedom
for which they've hungered for so long.
